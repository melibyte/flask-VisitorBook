#  Visitor Book â€“ Flask-Based Web Application

This is a simple yet effective web application built with **Flask** that allows users to leave a message in a digital visitor book. They can enter their name, message, rating, and some additional information. The data is stored in JSON format and can be viewed, deleted, or restored later.

This project is a great example of a lightweight CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for those learning Flask or building small-scale feedback systems.
